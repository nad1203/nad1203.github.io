			<h1 class="heading-34">Project Summary</h1>
			<div class="text-block-18">Applied Learning Management System (LMS) is my first project at Applied Medical. I worked on this project 
				together with another UX Designer, Imran Makki. The main goal of this project is to provide a more tailored application that 
				suits the needs of the learning team and makes learning easier for team members. The problem with the current application is that 
				it's not very intuitive and it also presents too many obstacles to complete just one training.</br></br>This project was divided 
				into 2 phases. The first phase covers only one section which is the Quality Document. This is the most important section on 
				Applied Learning where team members would come to complete their assigned quality documents before the deadline. The second 
				phase covers the rest 9 sections (Training, Catalog, Course Assignment, Course Management, ILT, Curriculum Creation, Admin 
				Creation, and Test Engine). In this case study, we will focus on the first phase that covers only Quality Document.

			<h1 class="heading-34">Project Constraints</h1>
			<div class="text-block-15">
				<ul role="list" class="list-6">
				<li>The tight timeline for the project limits the design and development to focus on the MVP.</li>
				<li>Some features have to be cut in the first phase to meet deadlines.</li>
				<li>Thinking ahead of how the Quality Document section will work with the rest of the features 
					in Phase 2. Solving the problem holistically by keeping in mind the other upcoming features and 
					different views for various user types.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<div>
		<div class="section-31"><h1 class="heading-33-copy">Research</h1>
			<div class="text-block-15">Before we started designing, we did a competitive analysis between the current 
				application and other existing learning management systems in the market (Coursera, Udemy, etc.). 
				From there, we listed a couple of pain points of the current LMS and listed out features that we find 
				as "potentially useful" for our users. We run through this list together with the learning team, explaining 
				our reasoning and giving a couple of scenarios where we think the proposed features will be helpful for 
				the users.
			</div>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="div-block-74">
		<div class="section-31"><h1 class="heading-33-copy">Pain Points</h1>
			<div class="text-block-15">Some of the pain points on the current learning management system:</div>
			<div class="text-block-15">
				<ul role="list" class="list-6">
				<li>Too many clicks are required to complete an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). There are 
					around 5 clicks to mark an SOP as "Completed".</li>
				<li>SOP document PDF needs to be downloaded (Team members can't view it online). This adds an extra 
					step to view the material itself.</li>
				<li>There's no ability to check if a training PDF has been read by team members. Once the PDF has 
					been downloaded, the option to mark that training as completed will be visible right away. This 
					loophole raises concern that team members might not review the material.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="section-31">
		<h1 class="heading-33-copy">Sketches</h1>
			<div class="text-block-15">While doing competitive analysis, I also noted 
				a couple of things that are nice to have and sketched a couple of layouts for the "Quality Docs" section.
			</div>
			<div class="div-block-57">
				<img src="img/LMS/onboarding sketch.jpg" alt=""/></br>
			</div>
			<div class="text-block-15">
				After exploring a couple of page layouts, we decided on using a two-card system. This solution solves our main 
				objective which is to cut down training completion time. A couple of advantages from this two-card system:
				<ul role="list" class="list-6">
				<li>Team members can preview and see the length of the document. This feature will help them decide whether they 
					have the time to complete that document at that moment.</li>
				<li>Team members have two options to view their documents. They can either view the material on the two-card 
					preview mode (the PDF text size is still legible to read) or on the full-screen view mode.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="text-block-15">Below is the sitemap of Applied Learning that applies to individual contributor team 
				members and managers. I exclude the sections that are only available for admins from the sitemap below to 
				keep it simple as we'll only be covering a small part of the project in this case study (Quality Docs - Phase 1).

			<h1 class="heading-33-copy">Wireframes</h1>
			<div class="text-block-21">While keeping in mind the main goal of this project—reducing the number of steps to 
				reduce the time of completion—I mocked up a couple of wireframes to gather initial feedback from the learning 
				team and Engineers for feasibility.</br>

			<h1 class="heading-33">Style Guide</h1>
			<div class="text-block-21">Around the same time, I also got the opportunity to create a design system for the 
				UI/UX team—our team is pretty new hence there's no existing design system. I compiled styles across other 
				released projects, sorted them out, and created one concise style that the team could use. (More information 
				on design system project - coming soon)

			<h1 class="heading-33">Collecting Feedback</h1>
			<div class="text-block-21">For a month before its launch, we made Applied Learning visible only to a couple of 
				selected team members from different departments and positions. The goal is to get feedback from users with 
				different backgrounds (various age groups and levels of tech-savviness).</br></br>
				Based on these test users, there are no concerning problems encountered. The only change we made was moving 
				the description of SOPs to a modal instead of including it as part of the card. The reason for this change 
				is because we found out that team members don't usually pay attention to this extra information since it's 
				not relevant for them—the description is beneficial only for the admins.
			</div>
		</div>	
		
		
		<div class="section-31">
			<h1 class="heading-33">Mockups</h1>
			<div class="text-block-21">After collecting user feedback, we made updates on the Figma mockup screens and share the changes 
				with engineers. We worked closely with the Front-end team to ensure everything aligned with the designs before the launch.</br>
			
				The mockup screens below are the final design after addressing the user feedback and a couple of new requirements requested 
				by the learning team.</br></br>  
				<strong>Some of the changes are:</strong>
			<div class="text-block-15">
				<ul role="list" class="list-6">
				<li>Removed "Description" on the card details and placed it as an info button on the right card.</li>
				<li>Added the "My Dashboard" button on the top right corner. This was a new requirement, which allows team members to access 
					their transcripts on a temporary dashboard page. (Note: "Dashboard" needs to be pushed back for future updates due to time limitations.)</li>
				<li>Added the "Reports" button on the top right corner—only visible for managers. Clicking on this button will open the Power BI 
					window where managers can view their team's transcript.</li>
				</ul>

			<h1 class="heading-33">Results and Takeaways</h1>
			<div class="text-block-21">We are so proud to finish Phase 1 of this project on time. Since its launch in Jan 2020, we have 
				been receiving lots of positive feedback about how it's more user-friendly and efficient compared to the old LMS. With 
				the new LMS, we managed to cut down the time spent by team members in completing their training. From 5 clicks to 3 
				clicks—40% time reduction for task completion.
