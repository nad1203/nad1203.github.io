				<h4><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>
				<p>There's no easy way to keep track of tons of job applications that you have 
				sent out during your job search. Every time you applied for a job, all you 
				get are tons of email that end up filling up your inbox. You might even forget 
				the jobs that you've applied for and ended up sending another application for the 
				same position.
</p></br>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h4><strong>The Solution</strong></h4>
				<p>Job Bot is a web application built with job seekers in mind. This 
				application is suitable for a lot of people, ranging from students who 
				are looking for internships to people who are looking for a full-time job.</p>

				<p><b style="color:#74bee1">Our goal is to ease the process of applying for a job by providing a page 
				where users could view their applications history</b>. This main feature offers 
				a better alternative to keep track of job applications compared to the existing 
				job search app which only sends users separate confirmation emails for each position 
				that the users have applied.</p></br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h4><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h4>
				<p>The first step that I took after I have identified the problem is to do a 
				competitive analysis on some of the existing job search app. By doing competitive 
				analysis on the current job search app, I could identify which features are 
				essential to be included in my app and if possible, to create new features 
				that could improve job searching experience.<p>

			</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h4><strong>User Research</strong></h4>
				<p>In this step, I identified the goals and the target audience to able to 
				approach the application goal by keeping the users in mind. Interviewing users is also one of
				the essential parts which allow us to be able to understand our users and to empathize with them.
				</p>

				<p>From conducting this user research, I was able to understand the issues that students and
				other people encounter while searching for internships and jobs. 
				One of the main problems rose after the career fair week that UCSD had every 
				Fall quarter. Most of the companies at the fair ended up asking students to 
				apply online. A large number of online applications are hard to keep track. 
				In the end, a lot of students forgot what companies they had applied for and ended 
				up trying to apply for the same position. This causes a problem because filling 
				in a job application waste a lot of time, especially if when you tried to submit 
				and it said: "You've already applied." It can be frustrating.</p>

				<p>After I have finished collecting data from this user research, I made a couple of storyboards to reflect 
				the problems and solutions that could be achieved by using our application. Creating the storyboards helps our 
				team to be able to empathize with our users. Throughout the project, we constantly refer back to the storyboards 
				to make sure that we have addressed all of the user needs in our design and implementation. 
				Below is one of the storyboards:</p></br>

				<!-- Modal Caption (Image Text) -->
				<div id="caption3"></div>
			</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4><strong>Paper Prototype</strong></h4>
			<p>Once I have completely understood our user's needs, I start creating the wireframes of our app 
			to construct the user flow of the app. First, I sketched out the wireframes on paper. 
			Then to check out on the completeness of the user flow, we conducted a 
			user test to figure out any missing elements or flow.</p>
			<img id="myImg4" src="img/Job Bot/paper prototype.jpg" alt="Paper Prototype" style="width:90%; margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<!-- The Modal -->
			<div id="myModal4" class="mod4">

				<span class="exit4">&times;</span>
				<!-- Modal Content (The Image) -->
				<img class="modal-content" id="img04">
				<!-- Modal Caption (Image Text) -->
				<div id="caption4"></div>
			</div>
			<p>After receiving feedback on our wireframes, we made some adjustments to the wireframes. 
			Through the user test, I can realize some missing elements that are important to bind the whole user flow together. 
			For example, we forgot to put a back button on some of the pages.
			</p></br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4><strong>Wireframes</strong></h4>
			<p>Moving on from the paper prototype, I created the low-fidelity digital wireframes using Adobe XD before I 
			start developing the actual working app with codes.

			<h4><strong>Heuristic Evaluation</strong></h4>
			<p>After I finished making the low-fidelity prototype, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the interface 
			design. I referred to Neilsen's 10 Heuristics to check if the interface design meets the requirements of the principles.</br></br>
			<b style="color:#74bee1">Some heuristics that my wireframes have fulfilled are:</b></br>
			<ul>
				<li>"Aesthetic and minimalist design" - only presenting relevant information and keep the design simple.</li></br>
				<li>"Consistency and standards" - the user interface design is consistent throughout the pages.</li></br>
				<li>"Match between system & world" - the wording that I use for this application isn't system-oriented.</li></br>
				<li> "Flexibility and efficiency of use" - there are back buttons on each page which allows the user to navigate easily.</li></br>
			</ul>
			The only principle that my app doesn't fulfill is regarding "visibility of the system status" due to the hamburger menu 
			that hides available menu options.
			</p></br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4><strong>Style Guide</strong></h4>
			<p>Before we started working on the hi-fi prototype, we construct a style guide which consists 
			of font styles, font weights, and color palettes to guarantee the UI styling consistency. I am 
			also in charge of creating the logo of the app. The first thing I do is making a rough sketch 
			of the logo with pencil and paper. Then finally, after I have shown it to my teammates and 
			received their approval, I started creating the logo on Adobe Photoshop.</p>

			</div>

			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4><strong>Usability Testing</strong></h4>
			<p>Usability testing was essential to get feedback from potential users. 
			The usability test was conducted by giving different tasks to users to complete using the 
			interface. </br></br><b style="color:#74bee1">User Testing Tasks:</b></br>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the Job Bot web app</li>
				<li>Sign in using Facebook login</li>
				<li>Browse for job openings that you are interested in</li>
				<li>Find a way to save the jobs that you like so that you could apply to them later</li>
				<li>View the jobs that you saved</li>
				<li>Apply for the job</li>
				<li>Track the status of the job you have applied</li>
			</ol></p>
			<p>During the process of completing the task, I observed the users and made notes if they have any difficulties. 
            I found that the bookmark button functionality was confusing because by clicking on it will only 
			lead users to the job description page where the actual bookmark button was placed on the bottom. 
			To overcome this problem, we make the bookmark icon actually to work. So when users click on it, 
			it will add the job to their bookmarks automatically without unnecessary steps.</p>
			<p>For the A/B tests, the two different interfaces design with different filter button wording and 
			bookmark icon functionality were tested to record the Google Analytics. By collecting data on which 
			buttons were being pressed the most or not being used at all, it was helpful to gain insight as to 
			which features needed to be improved or were not meaningful at all. The result will help us in 
			deciding which page design is better.</p></br>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4><strong>Takeaways</strong></h4>
			<p>We are proud and satisfied with the result that we have been working on for the last three months. 
			There sure are ups and downs during the process, but we managed to overcome all of it and bring a solution 			
			that could help users in overcoming their difficulties while searching for a job. 
			From working in a cross-functional group of three, we have learned the importance 
			of teamwork. Through brainstorming sessions, we could bring more useful features for 
			users. Not all the time, we could think of complete and perfect ideas alone. Lots of unique and 
			fascinating ideas were discovered together which allow us to combine and construct a 
			well-formed solution to the problem we’re tackling.</p>
			<p>If we have more time and could make changes to the project, we would want to add an automatic job 
			application status trackers where a rejected position will be removed from the user's application history list 
			automatically. I wish we could also find a more efficient way to do the A/B testing to achieve a 
			significant chi-square result.</p></br>
